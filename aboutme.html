			<h5>
				My name is Dhruvi Mehta, I am from Singapore. I was born in India but I have grown up in Singapore. I moved to Singapore when I was five, and have lived there for fifteen years now.I graduated high school in 2019 from UWCSEA east, and am currently a junior in Communication Design at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. I am keen to take on this opportunity to explore the city and gain inspiration to create new art. I really enjoy working with motion graphics, web-design and even package design. I am always open to learn about new places, concepts andtechniques, please feel free to reach out! I initially started of with wanting to major in Integrated Design and then ended switching to Communication Design. I am excited to explore and learn more about coding, and developing my skills and learning new languages.  I am excited to spend the next few years in New York City at Parsons
